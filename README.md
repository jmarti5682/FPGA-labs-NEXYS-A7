# FPGA LABS - NEXYS A7
The goal of this repo is to show off a series of labs assigned in the course CPE487: Digital System Design. The aim is to have all the labs done in VHDL and in Verilog. All labs are meant to be on the Digilent Nexys A7-100T Development board.  

**DISCLAIMER:** I am also using this repo to teach myself how to use Verilog and bushing up on my VHDL, so excuse me if there are some mistakes in this repo! 

Here are some other uesful resources that helped me to create this repo:\

*Also thanks to Prof. Yett for allowing me to borrow a FPGA for this!*
